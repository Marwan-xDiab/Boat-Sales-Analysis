- Because tastes fluctuate from one country to the next, it is recommended that each advertisement be adapted for each unique country.
- Because Switzerland and Germany have a high number of viewers, they are of importance to us, thus it is advisable to publish an advertising and a separate bulletin for them to clearly express their consumer preferences.
